# System Engineering & DevOps Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains the projects that I completed as a part of the System Engineering & DevOps curriculum at Holberton School. These projects cover various topics such as shell basics, shell permissions, shell redirections, shell variables and expansions, loops, conditions, parsing, processes, and signals.

## Projects

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README file with a detailed description of the project and its requirements. The projects are:

- **0x00-shell_basics:** This project covers basic shell commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, and `echo`.

- **0x01-shell_permissions:** This project covers shell permissions and how to use `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` to modify them.

- **0x02-shell_redirections:** This project covers shell redirections and how to use `>`, `>>`, `<`, and `|` to redirect input and output.

- **0x03-shell_variables_expansions:** This project covers shell variables and expansions, including how to use environment variables, parameter expansions, command substitutions, and arithmetic expansions.

- **0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing:** This project covers loops, conditions, and parsing in the shell, including how to use `for` and `while` loops, `if` statements, and parsing tools such as `cut`, `awk`, and `sed`.

- **0x05-processes_and_signals:** This project covers processes and signals in the shell, including how to use `ps`, `kill`, and `jobs` to manage processes and how to handle signals.

- **command_line_for_the_win:** This is a series of 31 small command-line challenges to test your knowledge of various shell commands and concepts.
